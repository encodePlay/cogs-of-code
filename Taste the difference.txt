The product label says Drinking Chocolate, the branding says it is from the "Taste the Difference" range. My brain thinks, how can I taste a difference?
Arrithmatists will claim that the difference between 3 and 5 is 2; 2 being a common ground between 3 and 5. I assume therefore, to "Taste the Differnce" I must first locate the other thing then find whatever it is that seperates the two.
Clearely, marketing people know something about how the human brain (at least the one in the English speaking world) handles logic. The product label is made to cause a mistake. A tactical error if you like. I am supposed to take the claim for granted. It assumes my brain is too lazy to process the message (TLDR), and I am prompted to think there is our product, a thing if beauty and there are all the rest that are not worthy. But even if I try to process the logic of the claim, they have ommited all the frames of reference that I would need for a valid comparison.
In fact we are more likely to ask questions in the form of "what is the difference beteen.." When we should really be asking how to categorise each item. Long before we should ever compare things, we need to investigate what these things are, what are their properties, in which set do they live.
